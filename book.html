                In this chapter, I'm going to introduce you to the Bootstrap card
                component and walk you through its many features and uses. By the end of
                this tutorial, you'll be able to incorporate Bootstrap cards in your web

                Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
                quickly creating responsive and mobile-first web layouts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using Bootstrap offers many advantages to developers, including the
                following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  you can easily and quickly build a responsive layout by having only
                  some knowledge of HTML and CSS
                </li>
                <li>the library was built to be mobile-first from the core</li>
                <li>it's compatible with all modern browsers etc.</li>
                <li>it uses Flexbox for its grid system</li>
                <li>it provides tons of features and components.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The latest release of Bootstrap offers many new, modern features ---
                such as the support for Flexbox, and the new <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/" target="_blank"></a>card
                component
                , which
                    replaces panels, thumbnails and wells from earlier versions of the
                    library.
              </p>
              <h2 id="what-is-the-bootstrap-card-component-">What Is the Bootstrap Card Component?</h2>
              <p>
                Bootstrap introduces a new UI component for creating cards which
                provides a flexible and stylish container for showing content. Cards
                come with minimal styling, but you can easily extend them with extra
                styling options.
              </p>
              <p>This component is built on top of Flexbox, and you can use the Bootstrap<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/" target="_blank">
                  spacing utility
                  classes for margins and padding.</a></p>
              <p>
                Cards can conveniently accommodate different types of content like
                title, subtitle, body copy, and images etc., and optional header and
                footer sections. You can also include different sections (card blocks)
                to construct different types of cards depending on your use.
              </p>
              <h2 id="including-bootstrap-in-your-project">Including Bootstrap in Your Project</h2>
              <p>
                You can very easily start using Bootstrap in your website by either
                including it from a CDN or downloading it from<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">getbootstrap.com</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the sake of introducing the new Bootstrap card component, you're
                going to create a simple HTML page with Bootstrap styling to demonstrate
                the basic elements of the card component. Go ahead and create the<code>index.html</code> file inside your project folder, then add the following
                    content from the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">
                  docs starter
                  template</a>:
              </p>
              <p>
                We've included Bootstrap files and their dependencies (jQuery and
                popper.js) from different CDNs, then created a container division.
              </p>
              <h2 id="minimal-styling-for-cards">Minimal Styling for Cards</h2>
              <p>In order to create a basic card, we need to ---</p>
              <ul>
                <li>use <code>.card</code> with a <code>div</code> tag to create the outer container</li>
                <li>add the <code>.card-body</code> class to an inner <code>div</code> tag to create the card
                        body
                </li>
                <li>use <code>.card-title</code> and <code>card-subtitle</code> classes with heading tags for
                        adding the title and the subtitle
                </li>
                <li>use the <code>card-text</code> class with <code><p></code> tags to add textual content</li>
                <li>use the <code>card-img-top</code> class with the <code><img></code> tag to add an image to
                        the top of the card.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These are the basic elements that constitute a full but basic card
                layout, as we can see from the following example:
              </p>
              <p>This is a screenshot of the result:</p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518996722basic-card-1024x728.jpg" alt="Bootstrap card component: Basic card            layout"/></p>
              <p>As can be seen, the card takes the full width of its container <code>div</code>.</p>
              <p>By simply switching the <code>card-body</code> class with the <code>card-img-overlay</code>    class, we can use the image as an overlay:</p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518999808adding-card-deck-1024x187.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding a .card-deck class to a parent div"/></p>
              <p>We can also use the class <code>.card-img-bottom</code> with the <code><img></code> tag to add
                    the image at the bottom of the card:
              </p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518997006image-bottom.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding the image at the bottom of the card"/></p>
              <p>The card top and bottom images are called <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#image-caps" target="_blank">
                  image
                  caps</a>.</p>
              <h2 id="controlling-bootstrap-card-component-width-and-height">
                Controlling Bootstrap Card Component Width and
                Height
              </h2>
              <p>
                By default, cards take all the available width in their parent
                container, but you can use the <code>width</code> and <code>max-width</code> classes to
                    control take control of the card's dimensions. So, let's change the
                    previous example by reducing the width of the card:
              </p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518997200reduce-width-1024x277.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Reducing card width"/></p>
              <p>
                Normally, the height of the card will be adjusted to vertically fit the
                content of the card, but we can also control it using custom CSS (for
                example, <code>style=" height: 10rem;"</code>) or Bootstrap's sizing utilities (for
                    examle, <code><div class="card h-200"></code>).
              </p>
              <p>Please, note that the latest release of Bootstrap has switched to <em>rem</em>    units instead of _px_ units because <em>rem</em> is a scalable measurement unit
                    --- so it works better with user settings, which makes text much <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/making-bootstrap-accessible/" target="_blank">
                  more
                  accessible</a>. The
                    result is that all elements in the page will scale with the screen size.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another option for controlling the width of the Bootstrap card component
                is to use the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/" target="_blank">
                  Bootstrap
                  grid</a> (rows and columns):
              </p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518998143card-width-grid-1024x272.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Controlling card width with Bootstrap grid"/></p>
              <h2 id="bootstrap-card-component-header-and-footer">Bootstrap Card Component Header and Footer</h2>
              <p>
                A Bootstrap card component can optionally have a header and footer by
                adding heading ( <code><h*></code>) and <code>div</code> tags with <code>.card-header</code> and<code>.card-footer</code> classes respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Continuing with our example, let's add a header and footer to our
                Bootstrap card component:
              </p>
              <p>This is the screenshot of the result:</p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518998319adding-header-footer-1024x321.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding a header and footer"/></p>
              <h2 id="adding-navigation">Adding Navigation</h2>
              <p>
                Another nice feature of the Bootstrap card component is the possibility
                of adding advanced navigation patterns to the header section such as
                tabs and navigation pills.
              </p>
              <p>
                So let's change our simple example by adding a tabbed navigation element
                to the header section of the card with the <code>.nav-tabs</code> and<code>.card-header-tabs</code> classes on the <code><ul></code> tag:
              </p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518998509tabbed-navigation-1024x325.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding a tabbed navigation element"/></p>
              <p>In the same way, we can add navigation pills by simply replacing<code>.nav-tabs</code> with <code>nav-pills</code> and <code>.card-header-tabs</code> with<code>card-header-pill</code> on the <code><ul></code> list tag:</p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518998670navigation-pills-1024x334.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding navigation pills"/></p>
              <p>You can find out more information about this in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/" target="_blank">
                  Bootstrap

                  documentation</a>.</p>
              <h2 id="adding-links-to-the-bootstrap-card-component">Adding Links to the Bootstrap Card Component</h2>
              <p>We can quickly add links inside cards using the <code><a></code> tag with a<code>.card-link</code> class:</p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518998851adding-links-1024x160.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding links inside cards"/></p>

              <p>We can use different Bootstrap classes ( <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/text/" target="_blank">
                  text
                  utilities</a>) to align
                    text within a card component such as <code>.text-left</code> (align text to left),<code>.text-right</code> (align text to right), <code>.text-center</code> (center text),<code>.text-justify</code> (justify text) and <code>.text-nowrap</code> (prevent text from
                    wrapping).
              </p>
              <p>We can also apply text transformation with <code>.text-lowercase</code> (transform
                    text to lowercase), <code>.text-uppercase</code> (transform text to uppercase) and<code>.text-capitalize</code> (transform the first letter of each word to

              <p>
                A Bootstrap card component's background and foreground colors can be

                Creating Advanced Layouts with the Bootstrap

              <p>
                The card is a modern UI component that's utilized in many websites as a
                way to display items of mixed and different content types (such as text
                and images etc.) as a single/grouped entity, but more commonly as a
                collection of similar items with a different or the same width and
                height. A popular layout where cards can be used is the <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-masonry-layout/" target="_blank">
                  Masonry
                  layout</a>, also
                    called the Pinterest-like Layout
              </p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518999430pinterest-card-layout-1024x728.png" alt="A Pinterest card layout"/></p>
              <p>
                Cards can be used for creating layouts for image albums, blog posts,
                ecommerce products etc. Big companies like Google and Facebook are
                making use of cards for their different web platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Normally, if we want to create complex layouts based on cards, we'd need
                to have deep knowledge of CSS and HTML. However, thanks to the latest
                features of Bootstrap, we can quickly build such layouts by wrapping our
                set of cards inside <code>div</code>s with some special classes such as<code>.card-group</code>, <code>.card-deck</code> and <code>.card-columns</code>.
              </p>
              <h3 id="grouping-nesting-cards">Grouping/Nesting Cards</h3>
              <p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#card-groups" target="_blank">Groups</a>    are used to display multiple Bootstrap card components as single and
                    attached elements with uniform sizing --- that is, cards have the same
                    width and height. This is achieved using the <code>display: flex;</code> property.
              </p>
              <p>We can create a group of cards using the <code>.card-group</code> class with a
                    wrapper <code>div</code> that contains the child cards.
              </p>
              <p>Let's add the following code to create a group with three cards:</p>
              <p>This is a screenshot of the result:</p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518999682card-group-1024x193.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Creating a group with three cards"/></p>
              <p>
                As can be seen, the three cards are attached and have the same width and
                height.
              </p>
              <h3 id="card-decks">Card Decks</h3>
              <p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#card-decks" target="_blank">Decks</a>    provide you with a layout similar to the previous one (that is, same
                    width and height for each card) but with the one difference that cards
                    are not attached to each other.
              </p>
              <p>We can simply add a <code>.card-deck</code> class to a parent <code>div</code> element to
                    create a card deck:
              </p>
              <p class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518999808adding-card-deck-1024x187.png" alt="Bootstrap card component: Adding a .card-deck class to a parent div"/></p>
              <p>
                As we can see, the cards are of the same size with some margin between
                them.
              </p>
              <h3 id="card-columns">Card Columns</h3>
              <p>
                Just like groups and decks, card columns can be used to lay out a set of
                cards in a Masonry-like style. We can achieve this popular layout style
                simply by wrapping our cards in a <code>div</code> and adding the <code>.card-columns</code>    class. That's all we need to do and Bootstrap will take care of the rest
                    without having to use a JavaScript/jQuery plugin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bootstrap uses CSS columns to create the Masonry-like layout where cards
                are added from top to bottom and left to right. However, if we need a<a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17882" target="_blank">
                  different kind of
                  behavior</a> based on some
                    algorithm, we'll have to resort to a JavaScript library or a jQuery
                    plugin like <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry</a>.
              </p>
              <h2 id="conclusion-6">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                The Bootstrap card component is a powerful addition to the Bootstrap
                framework, which allows developers to create modern-style web pages
                without going deeply into how CSS works. You can add card layouts to
                represent image galleries, dashboard widgets, to display blog posts or
                products for an ecommerce website, by just adding a bunch of CSS
                classes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result of the new features and components, Bootstrap continues to
                be a powerful CSS framework available to everyone, particularly to
                developers who need to create their own responsive and modern-style
                layouts but lack enough time and budget, or the deep knowledge of CSS,
                necessary to produce custom code.
