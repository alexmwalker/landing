<p>The <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/">first stable release of Bootstrap 4</a> is here. And it's pretty cool. This article looks at some of its best features.</p>
<p>It was on 19th August, 2015, that <a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/">Bootstrap 4 alpha</a> was finally out. This was after months of anticipation, anxious tweets asking for the disclosure of a release date, and a few scattered <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo/status/591364406816079873">scraps of news</a> by <a href="http://markdotto.com/">Mark Otto</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/fat">Jacob Thornton</a>, having the effect of intensifying rather than quenching our curiosity. More than two years later, the wait for the first stable release is finally over.</p>
<p>As a designer, I love crafting my own CSS. However, I confess that I find Bootstrap a well thought out and strongly supported front-end framework that I’ve immensely enjoyed using — both for building my projects and for learning more about writing better, modular CSS.</p>
<p>As soon as news of the latest release was out, I downloaded the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/">source files for Bootstrap 4</a> and spent some time going back and forth between reading <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">the docs</a> and digging into the code to find out more.</p>
<p>Here are the latest Bootstrap features I like the most. I hope you find them awesome too!</p>
<h2>#1 New Interactive Documentation</h2>
<p>The Bootstrap documentation has been exemplary since the framework’s early days. It’s always had the crucial role of being a <em>living document</em> — that is, a tool in sync with the collaborative effort of building the framework and communicating it to others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstracting and documenting components became part of our process for building this one tool and Bootstrap in tandem. — <em><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/building-twitter-bootstrap">Mark Otto in 2012</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark himself is quite a fan of great documentation. His <a href="http://codeguide.co/">Code Guide by @mdo</a> is evidence of his attitude that high-quality documentation is part and parcel of writing high-quality code.</p>
<p>The documentation for version 4 has been rewritten from scratch using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and its appearance has been revamped with a new layout, color palette, and the use of system fonts.</p>
