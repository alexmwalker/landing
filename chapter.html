      <p>
        React is a remarkable JavaScript library that's taken the development community by storm. In a nutshell,
        it's made it easier for developers to build interactive user interfaces for web, mobile and desktop
        platforms. One of its best features is its freedom from the problematic bugs inherent in MVC frameworks, where
        inconsistent views is a recurring problem for big projects. Today, thousands of companies worldwide are using
        React, including big names such as Netflix and AirBnB. React has become immensely popular, such that a number
        of apps have been ported to React --- including WhatsApp, Instagram and Dropbox.
      </p>
      <p>This book is a collection of articles, selected from SitePoint's <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript/react/">
          React
          Hub</a>, that will guide you through your first week with the amazingly flexible library.</p>
      <h2 id="who-should-read-this-book-">Who Should Read This Book?</h2>
      <p>
        This book is for all Frontend developers that want to build sites and apps that run faster. You’ll need to be
        familiar with HTML and CSS and have a reasonable level of understanding of JavaScript in order to follow the
        discussion.
      </p>
      <h2 id="conventions-used">Conventions Used</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll notice that we’ve used certain typographic and layout styles throughout this book to signify different
        types of information. Look out for the following items.
      </p>
      <h3 id="code-samples">Code Samples</h3>
      <p>Code in this book is displayed using a fixed-width font, like so:</p>
      <pre class="language-markup">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </pre>
      <p>Where existing code is required for context, rather than repeat all of it, ⋮ will be displayed:</p>
      <pre class="language-js">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </pre>
      <p>
        Some lines of code should be entered on one line, but we’ve had to wrap them because of page constraints. An ➥
        indicates a line break that exists for formatting purposes only, and should be ignored:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-js">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t

    <p><strong><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> stands as one of the most
                  popular, open-source, front-end frameworks on the Web. Since its
                  official release in 2011, it has undergone several changes, and it's now
                  one of the most stable and responsive frameworks available. It's loved
                  by web developers of all levels, as it gives them the capability to
                  build a functional, attractive website design within minutes. A novice
                  developer with just some basic knowledge of HTML and little CSS can
                  easily get started with Bootstrap.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Bootstrap provides a solid foundation for any website, irrespective of
      project size. It contains<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/" target="_blank">Reboot</a>, which is
              based on <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">Normalize.css</a> and
              helps level out browser differences for various page elements. Bootstrap
              also provides great typography. Even basic HTML form elements like
              checkboxes, radio buttons, select options, etc., have been restyled to
              give them a modern look. I use Bootstrap because it saves me a
              considerable amount of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today's websites should be modern, sleek, responsive, and "mobile
      first". Bootstrap helps us to achieve these goals with minimum fuss.
      Here are the top five reasons why I love Bootstrap:
    </p>
    <h2 id="reason-1-the-powerful-grid-system">Reason 1: The Powerful Grid System</h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap has one of the best responsive, mobile-first grid systems
      available. It's built with Flexbox and it's easy to use. It helps in
      scaling a single website design from the smallest mobile device to
      high-definition displays, logically dividing the screen into 12 columns,
      so that you can decide just how much screen real estate each element of
      your design should take up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although developers have CSS Grid Layout for layout building, the
      Bootstrap Grid component can still be handy for quick prototyping --- at
      least while we get more familiar with the new native CSS tool at our
      disposal today.
    </p>
    <h2 id="reason-2-rapid-development">Reason 2: Rapid Development</h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap comes complete with many reusable CSS and JavaScript
      components that can help achieve the functionality needed in almost any
      kind of website. You just have to use some HTML to plug them into your
      template, with no need to spend huge amounts of time writing complex CSS
      and JavaScript. Plus, all these components are responsive, too!
    </p>
    <h2 id="reason-3-browser-compatibility">Reason 3: Browser Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap is compatible with the latest, stable releases of all major
      browsers and platforms. With regard to the Windows platform, Bootstrap
      works in Internet Explorer versions 10--11 and Microsoft Edge. If
      Bootstrap's instructions are followed properly, you can create a website
      design that works in all these browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if your employer wants to make a website that looks exactly
      the same in IE7--8 as it does in modern, standards-compliant browsers,
      then it might be time to think about switching jobs!
    </p>
    <h2 id="reason-4-customization-">Reason 4: Customization!</h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap offers many ways to customize its default design. You can
      override all of its CSS and default JavaScript behavior. Bootstrap is
      even more interesting if you're a <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> developer, as it includes Sass customization options. These options let
              you smoothly create a new template using Bootstrap.
    </p>
    <h2 id="reason-5-open-source">Reason 5: Open Source</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is an open-source project that's <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap" target="_blank">
        hosted on
        GitHub</a> and released under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">
        the MIT
        license</a>. This is one of the biggest
              reasons I use Bootstrap. My clients won't have to deal with purchasing
              and licensing issues, and Bootstrap's license gives me the freedom to
              completely change and experiment with it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="want-to-learn-bootstrap-">Want to Learn Bootstrap?</h2>
    <p>SitePoint has published my book on Bootstrap called " <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-bootstrap" target="_blank">
        Jump
        Start
        Bootstrap</a>".
              It teaches you how to get started with Bootstrap. Apart from teaching
              you how to use Bootstrap's components and plugins, it also covers how to
              customize them through options like Less and Sass. A major section has
              been dedicated to Bootstrap's grid system, which is the most important
              aspect of creating a responsive website design. You'll also learn to
              create many demo website designs throughout the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully you found this article interesting, and it has convinced you
      to try Bootstrap in your future projects.
