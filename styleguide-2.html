    <p>Now, you've got to listen to me! You have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louie?</p>

    <p>Now, you've got to listen to me! You have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louie?</p>
  <h4 class="report">You're saying this only<br> to make me go</h4>
    <p>I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.</p>
  <h5 class="report">When I said I would never leave you</h5>
    <p>What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.</h5>

  <p class="report">And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that.

<p class="minor">This planet has – or rather <em>had</em> – a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the
movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole
it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of
  them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.</p>
