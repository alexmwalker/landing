              | In this chapter, I'm going to introduce you to the Bootstrap card
              | component and walk you through its many features and uses. By the end of
              | this tutorial, you'll be able to incorporate Bootstrap cards in your web
              | projects for great layouts and page content organization.
          p
            | Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
            | quickly creating responsive and mobile-first web layouts.
          p
            | Using Bootstrap offers many advantages to developers, including the
            | following:
          ul
            li
              | you can easily and quickly build a responsive layout by having only
              | some knowledge of HTML and CSS
            li the library was built to be mobile-first from the core
            li it's compatible with all modern browsers etc.
            li it uses Flexbox for its grid system
            li it provides tons of features and components.
          p
            | The latest release of Bootstrap offers many new, modern features ---
            | such as the support for Flexbox, and the new

            | card
            | component
            | , which
            |     replaces panels, thumbnails and wells from earlier versions of the
            |     library.
          h2#what-is-the-bootstrap-card-component- What Is the Bootstrap Card Component?
          p
            | Bootstrap introduces a new UI component for creating cards which
            | provides a flexible and stylish container for showing content. Cards
            | come with minimal styling, but you can easily extend them with extra
            | styling options.
          p
            | This component is built on top of Flexbox, and you can use the Bootstrap
            a(href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/', target='_blank')
              | spacing utility
              | classes for margins and padding.
          p
            | Cards can conveniently accommodate different types of content like
            | title, subtitle, body copy, and images etc., and optional header and
            | footer sections. You can also include different sections (card blocks)
            | to construct different types of cards depending on your use.
          h2#including-bootstrap-in-your-project Including Bootstrap in Your Project
          p
            | You can very easily start using Bootstrap in your website by either
            | including it from a CDN or downloading it from
            a(href='https://getbootstrap.com/', target='_blank') getbootstrap.com
            | .
          p
            | For the sake of introducing the new Bootstrap card component, you're
            | going to create a simple HTML page with Bootstrap styling to demonstrate
            | the basic elements of the card component. Go ahead and create the
            code index.html
            |  file inside your project folder, then add the following
            |     content from the 
            a(href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/', target='_blank')
              | docs starter
              | template
            | :

          p
            | We've included Bootstrap files and their dependencies (jQuery and
            | popper.js) from different CDNs, then created a container division.
          h2#minimal-styling-for-cards Minimal Styling for Cards
          p In order to create a basic card, we need to ---
          ul
            li
              | use 
              code .card
              |  with a 
              code div
              |  tag to create the outer container
            li
              | add the 
              code .card-body
              |  class to an inner 
              code div
              |  tag to create the card
              |       body
            li
              | use 
              code .card-title
              |  and 
              code card-subtitle
              |  classes with heading tags for
              |       adding the title and the subtitle
            li
              | use the 
              code card-text
              |  class with 
              code <p>
              |  tags to add textual content
            li
              | use the 
              code card-img-top
              |  class with the 
              code <img>
              |  tag to add an image to
              |       the top of the card.
          p
            | These are the basic elements that constitute a full but basic card
            | layout, as we can see from the following example:

          p This is a screenshot of the result:

            layout')
          p
            | As can be seen, the card takes the full width of its container 
            code div
            | .
          p
            | By simply switching the

            |  class with the 
            code card-img-overlay
            |     class, we can use the image as an overlay:

          p
            | We can also use the class

            |  with the 
            code <img>
            |  tag to add
            |     the image at the bottom of the card:

          h2#controlling-bootstrap-card-component-width-and-height
            | Controlling Bootstrap Card Component Width and
            | Height
          p
            | By default, cards take all the available width in their parent
            | container, but you can use the 
            code width
            |  and 
            code max-width
            |  classes to
            |     control take control of the card's dimensions. So, let's change the
            |     previous example by reducing the width of the card:

          p.image-wrapper
            img(src='https://learnable-static.s3.amazonaws.com/premium/reeedr/books/your-first-week-with-bootstrap/images/1518997200reduce-width-1024x277.png', alt='Bootstrap card component: Reducing card width')
          p
            | Normally, the height of the card will be adjusted to vertically fit the
            | content of the card, but we can also control it using custom CSS (for
            | example, 
            code style=" height: 10rem;"
            | ) or Bootstrap's sizing utilities (for
            |     examle, 
            code <div class="card h-200">
            | ).
          p
            | Please, note that the latest release of Bootstrap has switched to 
            em rem
            |     units instead of _px_ units because 
            em rem
            |  is a scalable measurement unit
            |     --- so it works better with user settings, which makes text much 
            a(href='https://www.sitepoint.com/making-bootstrap-accessible/', target='_blank')
              | more
              | accessible
            | . The
            |     result is that all elements in the page will scale with the screen size.
          p
            | Another option for controlling the width of the Bootstrap card component
            | is to use the 
            a(href='http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/', target='_blank')
              | Bootstrap
              | grid
            |  (rows and columns):

          h2#bootstrap-card-component-header-and-footer Bootstrap Card Component Header and Footer
          p
            | A Bootstrap card component can optionally have a header and footer by
            | adding heading ( 
            code <h*>
            | ) and 
            code div
            |  tags with 
            code .card-header
            |  and
            code .card-footer
            |  classes respectively.
          p
            | Continuing with our example, let's add a header and footer to our
            | Bootstrap card component:

          h2#adding-navigation Adding Navigation
          p
            | Another nice feature of the Bootstrap card component is the possibility
            | of adding advanced navigation patterns to the header section such as
            | tabs and navigation pills.
          p
            | So let's change our simple example by adding a tabbed navigation element
            | to the header section of the card with the 
            code .nav-tabs
            |  and
            code .card-header-tabs
            |  classes on the

          p
            | In the same way, we can add navigation pills by simply replacing
            code .nav-tabs
            |  with 
            code nav-pills
            |  and

          p
            | As can be seen, the three cards are attached and have the same width and
            | height.

            a(href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#card-decks', target='_blank') Decks
            |     provide you with a layout similar to the previous one (that is, same
            |     width and height for each card) but with the one difference that cards
            |     are not attached to each other.
          p
            | We can simply add a 
            code .card-deck
            |  class to a parent 
            code div
            |  element to
            |     create a card deck:

          p
            | As we can see, the cards are of the same size with some margin between
            | them.
          h3#card-columns Card Columns
          p
            | Just like groups and decks, card columns can be used to lay out a set of
            | cards in a Masonry-like style. We can achieve this popular layout style
            | simply by wrapping our cards in a 
            code div
            |  and adding the 
            code .card-columns
            |     class. That's all we need to do and Bootstrap will take care of the rest
            |     without having to use a JavaScript/jQuery plugin.
          p
            | Bootstrap uses CSS columns to create the Masonry-like layout where cards
            | are added from top to bottom and left to right. However, if we need a
            a(href='https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17882', target='_blank')
              | different kind of
              | behavior
            |  based on some
            |     algorithm, we'll have to resort to a JavaScript library or a jQuery
            |     plugin like 
            a(href='https://masonry.desandro.com/', target='_blank') Masonry

          h2#conclusion-6 Conclusion
          p
            | The Bootstrap card component is a powerful addition to the Bootstrap
            | framework, which allows developers to create modern-style web pages
            | without going deeply into how CSS works. You can add card layouts to
            | represent image galleries, dashboard widgets, to display blog posts or
            | products for an ecommerce website, by just adding a bunch of CSS
            | classes.
          p
            | As a result of the new features and components, Bootstrap continues to
            | be a powerful CSS framework available to everyone, particularly to
            | developers who need to create their own responsive and modern-style
            | layouts but lack enough time and budget, or the deep knowledge of CSS,
            | necessary to produce custom code.
