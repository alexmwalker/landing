  p
    | This is a standard Paragraph. EO is a marketing tactic that costs five percent of overall budget but brings in more than 20
    | percent of revenue for many Fortune 500 companies, and yet very few of them prioritize it. Instead,
    | while slowly changing, too many CMOS still favor paid search, which costs 20 percent and brings in… 20
    | percent. In search, businesses need to shift priorities. Now.
  p.minor
    | This is a Paragraph with a minor class (p.minor{}).  Link volume is one of the most powerful signals search engines use to rank websites. There’s a
    | way to use links to generate better search results, but too many marketers rely on traditional (or even
    | black hat) tactics that just don’t work anymore.
  p.small
    | This is a Paragraph with a small class (p.small{}) used for very small credits and captions.
