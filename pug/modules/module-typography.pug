    All Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc) are set by scaling up from that base font-size. 

    ```css
      --typescale: 1.15;
       /* This is the heading scaling factor relative to the <p>. 
       Each heading is 1.15 times bigger than one before ( h4 > h3 > h2 > h1). It's a 'type size ramp'.*/
    ```

    - P = 1rem
    - H4 = 1rem * 1.15
    - H3 = 1rem * 1.15 * 1.15
    - H2 = 1rem * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15
    - H1 = 1rem * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15

    It's true that the numbers generated by these formulas can seem messy when looked at in isolation (i.e. H1 might be 54.9316px). However, when viewed within the rest of the type system, they invariably appear balanced and harmonious. 

    On small phone screens we use a 'gentle typescale ramp' of 1.15 - this ensures our H1s aren't clumsily large on a small screen. 
    
    ```css
    /* Medium devices (tablets, 48em and up)*/
    @media (min-width: 48em) {
      :root {
        font-size: var(--basefont-tablet);
        --typescale: 1.25; /* we ramp up the typescale on non-phone screens.  */
      }
    }
    ```
    On any non-phone device we set a steeper `--typescale` of 1.25. This means the H1s will be proportionally larger than the P's - closer to a newspaper layout.
