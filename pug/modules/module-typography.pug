    ### How headings are scaled?
    
    All Headings sizes (H1, H2, H3, etc) are set by scaling up from our current base font-size. Changing our typescale only ever changes our headings. It has no effect on our body text size.

    On small phone screens we use a gentle typescale ramp of 1.15. This ensures our H1s aren't clumsily large on small screens. 

    ```css
      --typescale: 1.15;
       /* This is the default header scaling factor relative to the <p>. 
       Each heading is 1.15 times bigger than one before ( h4 > h3 > h2 > h1).  */
    ```

    - P = 1rem (*no typescale applied*)
    - H4 = 1rem * 1.15
    - H3 = 1rem * 1.15 * 1.15
    - H2 = 1rem * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15
    - H1 = 1rem * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15 * 1.15

    It's true that the numbers generated by these formulas can seem messy when looked at in isolation (i.e. H1 might be 54.9316px). However, when viewed within the rest of the type system, they invariably appear balanced and harmonious. 

    On larger device screens we set a steeper `--typescale` of 1.25. This means our H1s will be proportionally larger than our P's on screens â€“ more like the large titles in a newspaper layout.

    ```css
    /* Medium devices (tablets, 48em and up)*/
    @media (min-width: 48em) {
      :root {
        font-size: var(--basefont-tablet);
        --typescale: 1.25; /* we ramp up the typescale on non-phone screens.  */
      }
    }
    ```

    - P = 1rem 
    - H4 = 1rem * 1.25
    - H3 = 1rem * 1.25 * 1.25
    - H2 = 1rem * 1.25 * 1.25 * 1.25
    - H1 = 1rem * 1.25 * 1.25 * 1.25 * 1.25

    We are free to tweak either of these typescales if we decide there is either too much or too little variation in heading sizes at any screen size. Tweaking the typescale automatically tweaks ALL the headings.
