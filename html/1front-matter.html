<p>Bootstrap stands as one of the most popular, open-source, front-end frameworks on the Web. Since its official release in 2011, it has undergone several changes, and it’s now one of the most stable and responsive frameworks available. It’s loved by web developers of all levels, as it gives them the capability to build a functional, attractive website design within minutes. A novice developer with just some basic knowledge of HTML and little CSS can easily get started with Bootstrap.</p>
<p>In this book we&#39;ll take you through Bootstrap basics, introduce you to its major features, and get you building your first Bootstrap sites.</p>

<h3 id="code-samples">Code Samples</h3>
<p>Code in this book is displayed using a fixed-width font, like so:  </p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;h1&gt;A Perfect Summer&#39;s Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely day for a walk in the park.
The birds were singing and the kids were all back at school.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Where existing code is required for context, rather than repeat all of it, <code>⋮</code> will be displayed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">function animate() {
  ⋮
new_variable = &quot;Hello&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some lines of code should be entered on one line, but we’ve had to wrap them because of page constraints. An ➥ indicates a line break that exists for formatting purposes only, and should be ignored:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">URL.open(&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/responsive-web-
➥design-real-user-testing/?responsive1&quot;);
</code></pre>
