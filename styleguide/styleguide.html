            SEO is a marketing tactic that costs five percent of overall budget but brings in more than 20
            percent of revenue for many Fortune 500 companies, and yet very few of them prioritize it. Instead,
            while slowly changing, too many CMOS still favor paid search, which costs 20 percent and brings in… 20
            percent. In search, businesses need to shift priorities. Now.

            Link volume is one of the most powerful signals search engines use to rank websites. There’s a
            way to use links to generate better search results, but too many marketers rely on traditional (or even
            black hat) tactics that just don’t work anymore.

      <p>2). The CSS `line-height` for the basic `<p>` tag is very important as it becomes the default ‘lego brick height’ that everything else fits on. I’m setting a ‘line-height: 1.7778rem’.   (or 28/16 ). This is set as a Sass variable ($line-height). We should able to change this to 30/20 at any time and the design will adjust instantly.</p>
